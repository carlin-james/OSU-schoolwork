Using the time function, I was able to see that many of the functions we were given to use were too fast for the computer to find the correct time for
The only one that gave me a time was my recursive function, which was a surprise.
I expected the recursive function to take less time than the non-recursive, but I think it was because the numbers used were too small to really see the
power of the recursive function. I think it shows that a recursive function needs to have a strong base case and has to be used for large integers
to really be faster than a non-recursive function.
